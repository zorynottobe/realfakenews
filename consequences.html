<h3>
The Consequences of Fake News:
</h3>
<span> The underlying issue is what does fake news does to the average consumer besides entrapping
their attention.

<div id="sectionone">
<h4> Fake news has grown from controlling fashion trends to controlling societal beliefs. </h4>
<p>
The idea is that <span class="quote">“to societies have been exploited by politicians and corporations, when the media
creates a disoriented population. It has created the space for expanding the power of private
wealth over the political system...private media is given the role to be the watchdog to protect the
population from the abuse of power by the powerful. In such a system, are we being told the
truth about the function of our economies?” </span>

<p>
The average person is lied to about their country’s current political and economic state. The
media blinds the public and their opinions. As stated, one of the most direct consequences is a
disproportion power over the political system:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The wealthy have better access to reliable sources and therefore better access to the political
system.
</li>
<li>
The wealthy also has control over private media, dictating what the public knows and does not
know.
</li>
</ul>

<span> Consequently, the public has no direct access to the truth. </span>

<h4> Fake media corrupts the public easily. </h4>

<p style="padding: 30px;">
Fake media stimulates reliance in its readers, therefore <span class="quote"> “People tend to reproduce incorrect
information provided by their conversational partners, suggesting any lack of evaluation may be
a general outcome of memory and comprehension processes.” </span>
<br>
<br>
Fake media removes the ability to question. Rather than critique and view the Internet in a more
questionable way, the public takes all information as truthful, spreading them without any
evaluation.
